### Hi! (*＾▽＾)／  
### I'm Ari, also known as Typhoon Teaser online.  
### Always learning digital artist and Maker. You can find my portfolio and other links here [Typhoonteaser.com](typhoonteaser.com)
Love to draw and make comics, also to mess with hardware and software. Mostly to create things exactly how I need them. Will soon also offer freelance engineering services.  
This GitHub will be the place to store all the documentation about my design and maker projects to be publicly accessible. More detailed story on the process can be found on my [Hackaday profile](https://hackaday.io/typhoonteaser)
